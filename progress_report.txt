Set up the github repository 

downloaded spring framework sts and try to do a mvc example as the basis for my website

downloaded spring-mvc-showcase and was able to get it to run on the tomcat

used spring tool suite to create the spring mvc project from the template view and was able to get it to run

screwed up the servers folder and accidentally deleted it, probably need to reinstall the spring tool suit again
